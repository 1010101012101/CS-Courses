given 
given spy 
given session started when tick happens then one second has elapsed 
given a iteration parameter with a workflow step parameter configured when a workflow step parameter is set for the same workflow step then the new parameter replaces the old one 
given a typical iteration 
given an iteration parameter for a workflow step capacity exists in a given iteration when a value is set in the table for that workflow step capacity in that iteration and the workflow model is asked for simulator configuration then the corresponding iteration parameter has only the new value 
given an iteration parameter for batch size exists in a given iteration when a value is set in the table for batch size for that iteration and the workflow model is asked for simulator configuration then the corresponding iteration parameter has only the new value 
given an iteration parameter for batch size exists in a given iteration when the workflow model is asked for the corresponding cell value then that batch size value is returned 
given an iteration parameter for capacity exists in a given iteration when the workflow model is asked for the corresponding cell value then that capacity value is returned 
given an iteration result 
given an iteration exists when the workflow model is asked for the corresponding cell value of the iteration column then that iteration number is returned 
given configuration says to remove a workflow step when the iteration is configured then the iteration does not have that workflow step 
given configuration sets batch size when the iteration is configured then the batch size of the iteration is that value 
given configuration sets capacity for a workflow step when the iteration is configured then the capacity of that workflow step is that value 
given list of integers should sort it 
given the batch size is greater than available stories to play when the iteration is run then the number of stories put into play matches available stories 
given the batch size is less than available stories to play when the iteration is run then the number of stories put into play matches the batch size 
given the capacity for all workflow steps is greater than the batch size when the iteration is run then all stories are completed in the iteration 
given the capacity of a workflow step is less than batch size when the iteration is run then some stories are queued up 
given the capacity of a workflow step matches batch size when the iteration is run then all stories are completed and none are queued up 
given the iteration has stories queued in a workflow step and capacity of that step is less than stories available to play when the iteration is run then the queue increases 
given two configuration set the same parameter when the iteration is configured then the last configuration wins
